Java is a computer programming language that is concurrent, class-based, object-oriented,
and specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.
It is intended to let application developers "write once, run anywhere" (WORA), meaning 
that code that runs on one platform does not need to be recompiled to run on another.
Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual 
machine (JVM) regardless of computer architecture.
Java is, as of 2014, one of the most popular programming languages in use, particularly for 
client-server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers.
Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems 
(which has since merged into Oracle Corporation) and released in 1995 as a core component 
of Sun Microsystems' Java platform.
